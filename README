params\_proto, a collection of decorators that makes shell argument passing declarative
=======================================================================================

Now supports both python ``3.52`` as well as ``3.6``!

Todo

Done
~~~~

-  [x] publish
-  [x] add test
-  [x] add ``python3.52`` test on top of ``python3.6`` test.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install params_proto

Usage
-----

To use a python namespace to declare commandline argments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note that this is python >= 3.6 only**. The reason being the
annotation syntax is only supported by python 3.6 an above. If you feel
unhappy about this, just use javascript.

For python <= 3.5, you can declare each default value as a tuple.
``param_proto`` recognizes the python version that is being ran, and
changes its behavior.

Below is a simple example how to use python namespace to declare command
line arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    from .params_proto import cli_parse, is_hidden, ParamsProto, proto_signature


    def test_cli_proto():
        @cli_parse
        class G(ParamsProto):
            """Supervised MAML in tensorflow"""
            npts: "number of points to sample from distribution" = 100
            num_epochs: "number of epochs to train" = 70000
            num_tasks: "number of tasks in the inner loop" = 10
            num_grad_steps: "number of gradient descent steps in the inner loop" = 1
            num_points_sampled: "effectively the k-shot" = 10
            fix_amp: "controls the sampling, fix the amplitude of the sample distribution if True" = False

        assert G.npts == 100
        G.npts = 10
        assert G.npts == 10
        assert vars(G) == {'npts': 10, 'num_epochs': 70000, 'num_tasks': 10, 'num_grad_steps': 1,
                           'num_points_sampled': 10, 'fix_amp': False}
        assert G._proto is not None, '_proto should exist'

Setting Function Signatures using Python Namespace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

sometimes, you have a function with wildcard keyword argument signature.
It is annoying to work with such functions because the static type
analysis of the IDE doesn't tell you what needs to go in.

I originally wrote this decorator to help with that case, however the
dynamically set function signature won't show up in the IDE in general.
Use this for inspection purposes if you like.

Below si the usage example and the test case:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_proto_signature():
        @cli_parse
        class G(ParamsProto):
            """some parameter proto"""
            npts: "number of points to sample from distribution" = 100

        @proto_signature(G._proto)
        def main_demo(**kwargs):
            print('npts = ', kwargs['npts'])
            return kwargs['npts']

        # First way is to use proto_signature decorator. The dynamically generated signature
        # however does not show up in pyCharm. It does however, show during run time.
        import inspect

        assert main_demo(npts=10) == 10
        print("main_demo<Function> signature:", inspect.signature(main_demo))
        assert str(inspect.signature(main_demo)) == "(npts=100)"

To Develop
----------

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/episodeyang/params_proto.git
    cd params_proto
    make dev

To test, run the following under both python ``3.52`` and ``3.6``.

.. code-block:: bash

    make test

This ``make dev`` command should build the wheel and install it in your
current python environment. Take a look at the
`https://github.com/episodeyang/params_proto/blob/master/Makefile <https://github.com/episodeyang/params_proto/blob/master/Makefile>`__ for details.

**To publish**, first update the version number, then do:

.. code-block:: bash

    make publish
